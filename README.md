**Note:** Due to reaching the monthly quota limit on the Sky-Scrapper API (RapidAPI Basic Plan â€“ 20 requests/month), I have used realistic mock data for both airport suggestions and flight search results.
The mock data is directly sourced from the Sky-Scrapper API to ensure consistency and realism. The core logic, UI behavior, and component interactions remain identical to a live environment.
Once API access is available (e.g., via a paid plan), the mock functions can be seamlessly replaced with actual API calls without changing the UI or logic.
